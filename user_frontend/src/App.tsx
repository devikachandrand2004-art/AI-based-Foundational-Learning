    body: "A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. Everything around us has a name — and those names are nouns! Nouns are the building blocks of language. Without nouns, we could not talk about the people we love, the places we visit, the objects we use every day, or the feelings and ideas we experience. For example, 'Pikachu' is a noun because it names a character. 'School' is a noun because it names a place you go to learn. 'Ball' is a noun because it names an object you play with. Even invisible things like 'Happiness' and 'Freedom' are nouns because they name ideas. Nouns can be singular (one thing) or plural (more than one thing). They can be common nouns that name general things, or proper nouns that name specific people, places, and things. Understanding nouns helps us build sentences and communicate clearly.",

      "Pikachu ran to school.",
      "The ball is round and bouncy.",

    body: "A verb is a word that shows an action or a state of being. Every sentence needs a verb — without one, a sentence is incomplete! When Pikachu runs, jumps, or eats, those are all action verbs. Action verbs describe what a subject does: 'She sings', 'He jumps', 'They swim'. Linking verbs connect the subject to more information about it: 'She is happy', 'The sky looks blue'. Helping verbs (also called auxiliary verbs) work alongside main verbs to show tense, possibility, or necessity: 'She is running', 'He can fly', 'They should study'. Verbs also change form depending on tense — the same action can be described in the past, present, or future. For example, 'eat' becomes 'ate' in the past and 'will eat' in the future. Mastering verbs is essential for building clear, meaningful sentences in English.",

Which one? How much? For example, in the phrase 'a tall, blue mountain', both 'tall' and 'blue' are adjectives because they describe the mountain. Adjectives make our language vivid and precise — compare 'a dog' with 'a small, fluffy, playful dog'. The second description paints a much clearer picture! Adjectives can also be used in comparisons: 'She is taller than her sister' (comparative) and 'He is the tallest player on the team' (superlative). When multiple adjectives appear together, they usually follow a specific order: opinion, size, age, shape, colour, origin, material, purpose — for example, 'a lovely little old round green French silver whittling knife'.",

Present tense means the action is happening right now or happens regularly: 'I eat lunch every day.' Past tense means the action already happened before this moment: 'I ate lunch an hour ago.' Future tense means the action will happen at a later time: 'I will eat lunch at noon.' Each of these three main tenses is further divided into four aspects — Simple, Continuous (Progressive), Perfect, and Perfect Continuous — giving us twelve tenses in total. For example, the Present Continuous ('I am eating') shows an action happening right at this moment. The Past Perfect ('I had eaten') shows an action that was completed before another past action. Learning tenses helps us express exactly when events happen and how they relate to one another in time.",

We use the indefinite article 'A' before singular nouns that start with a consonant sound: 'a cat', 'a book', 'a university' (note: 'university' starts with a 'y' sound, which is a consonant sound). We use 'An' before singular nouns that start with a vowel sound: 'an apple', 'an egg', 'an honest man' (note: 'honest' starts with a silent 'h', so the vowel sound 'o' determines the article). We use the definite article 'The' when we are talking about a specific, particular noun that both the speaker and the listener know about: 'Please close the door', 'The sun is bright today', 'Did you feed the cat?' The definite article can be used with singular and plural nouns, and with countable and uncountable nouns. Choosing the right article is an important part of sounding natural in English.",

Prepositions of movement tell us where something is going: 'He walked through the park', 'She climbed up the ladder', 'The ball rolled across the floor'. Prepositions of manner describe how something is done: 'She sang with great emotion', 'He arrived by bus'.
